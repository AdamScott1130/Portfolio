### Problem 

We are tasked with testing an API for a food delivery service, similar to Doordash or Uber Eats. The API has two distinct routes, one for driver information and one for order information. The goal of the API is to find the closest available driver when an order comes in, so that they can be assigned to deliver it. However, calculating the distance between every active driver and the order would be a waste of resources, as the service is expected to operate across Canada and could potentially become international. So, each time a city is added to the service’s supported regions, that city is assigned an ID number which is associated with each driver and order. That way, we can narrow our potential drivers to only those in the same city as the order before calculating which is closest among those drivers using the stored latitude and longitude data. The route https://69372600f8dc350aff33811a.mockapi.io/api/drivers contains deliver driver info, and the other route, https://69372600f8dc350aff33811a.mockapi.io/api/orders contains order info.



### Solution

We need to validate each of the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with an API testing suite, organized and exported as a collection within Postman. We also need to keep in mind test coverage, including testing negative cases where they occur. We ensure consistency in our testing suite by first testing the Create functionality of each route, then saving the generated ID as a collection variable to use in URLs for the Read/Update/Delete request testing, using the Delete testing to clean up all data generated by the tests.



### Execution Instructions

To run this testing suite, open Postman and import the attached collection, then right click the collection and choose Run. Ensure all tests are selected and that you are on the Functional testing tab, then click the Run Food Delivery API Testing button. The collection doesn't require any special configuration to run, the only collection variables used are set at runtime during the POST tests. The collection deletes each driver/order it creates, so if you want to see API data reflected in your web browser, just run a POST request on its own.
